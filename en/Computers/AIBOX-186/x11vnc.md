# Remote Desktop X11VNC

x11vnc is a tool that allows administrators to connect to the server's real X desktop directly via VNC Viewer.

## Ubuntu
The Ubuntu system requires the manual installation of the X desktop environment. During the installation process, select lightdm as the Display Manager:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y xserver-xorg-video-dummy x11vnc xfce4
sudo vim /etc/X11/xorg.conf
sudo reboot
```
The contents of /etc/X11/xorg.conf are:
```
Section "Device"
    Identifier  "Configured Video Device"
    Driver      "dummy"
    VideoRam 256000
EndSection

Section "Monitor"
    Identifier  "Configured Monitor"
    HorizSync 5.0 - 1000.0
    VertRefresh 5.0 - 200.0
    ModeLine "1920x1080" 148.50 1920 2448 2492 2640 1080 1084 1089 1125 +Hsync +Vsync

EndSection

    Identifier  "Default Screen"
    Monitor     "Configured Monitor"
    Device      "Configured Video Device"
    DefaultDepth 24
    SubSection "Display"
    Depth 24
    Modes "1920x1080"
#    Modes "1280x800"
    EndSubSection
EndSection
```
After the installation is complete, start the x11vnc service:

```shell
sudo x11vnc -display :0 -auth /var/lib/lightdm/.Xauthority &
```

You can then use the `$bm1688_ip:0` address to VNC remote connect from a PC.

(1) Users first download [VNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/) from the official website, selecting the appropriate installation package based on their PC system.
