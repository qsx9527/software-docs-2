### ControlNet

ControlNet is a neural framework designed to enhance control over generative models by incorporating conditional inputs like edge maps, depth data, or semantic segmentation. Proposed by Lvmin Zhang and Maneesh Agrawala, it integrates with diffusion models to enable precise control over image composition, object placement, and stylistic details via sketches, pose cues, or structural constraints. Widely used in digital art, design prototyping, film previsualization, and photo editing, it trains conditional encoders alongside base models to harmonize creative flexibility with structural guidance. The framework supports multi-modal inputs and real-time interaction, though challenges include stabilizing complex condition integration, optimizing computational overhead, and preventing overfitting.

Phi-3.5-mini is a lightweight, state-of-the-art open model built upon datasets used for Phi-3 - synthetic data and filtered publicly available websites - with a focus on very high-quality, reasoning dense data. The model belongs to the Phi-3 model family and supports 128K token context length. The model underwent a rigorous enhancement process, incorporating both supervised fine-tuning, proximal policy optimization, and direct preference optimization to ensure precise instruction adherence and robust safety measures.

### HY-MT1.5-1.8B

Hunyuan Translation Model Version 1.5 includes a 1.8B translation model, HY-MT1.5-1.8B, and a 7B translation model, HY-MT1.5-7B. Both models focus on supporting mutual translation across 33 languages and incorporating 5 ethnic and dialect variations. Among them, HY-MT1.5-7B is an upgraded version of WMT25 championship model, optimized for explanatory translation and mixed-language scenarios, with newly added support for terminology intervention, contextual translation, and formatted translation. Despite having less than one-third the parameters of HY-MT1.5-7B, HY-MT1.5-1.8B delivers translation performance comparable to its larger counterpart, achieving both high speed and high quality. After quantization, the 1.8B model can be deployed on edge devices and support real-time translation scenarios, making it widely applicable.

### Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct

Qwen2.5-VL is the enhanced version of Qwen2-VL vision-language models. Key Enhancements:

1. Understand things visually: Qwen2.5-VL is not only proficient in recognizing common objects such as flowers, birds, fish, and insects, but it is highly capable of analyzing texts, charts, icons, graphics, and layouts within images.
2. Being agentic: Qwen2.5-VL directly plays as a visual agent that can reason and dynamically direct tools, which is capable of computer use and phone use.
3. Understanding long videos and capturing events: Qwen2.5-VL can comprehend videos of over 1 hour, and this time it has a new ability of cpaturing event by pinpointing the relevant video segments.
4. Capable of visual localization in different formats: Qwen2.5-VL can accurately localize objects in an image by generating bounding boxes or points, and it can provide stable JSON outputs for coordinates and attributes.
5. Generating structured outputs: for data like scans of invoices, forms, tables, etc. Qwen2.5-VL supports structured outputs of their contents, benefiting usages in finance, commerce, etc.

## AidGenSE

AidGenSE is a generative AI HTTP service that is based on AidGen and has been adapted to the OpenAI HTTP protocol. Developers can call the generative AI through HTTP and quickly integrate it into their own applications.

The following is an introduction to the usage of AidGenSE:

* Prepare AidGenSE environment
```bash
# setup python virtual env
sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3-venv > /dev/null 2>&1
sudo python3 -m venv /opt/aidlux/aid-python3

# create aid-python3 command
echo '#!/bin/bash
exec /opt/aidlux/aid-python3/bin/python3 "$@"' | sudo tee /usr/bin/aid-python3 > /dev/null
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/aid-python3

# create aid-pip3 command
echo '#!/bin/bash
exec /opt/aidlux/aid-python3/bin/python3 -m pip "$@"' | sudo tee /usr/bin/aid-pip3 > /dev/null
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/aid-pip3

# install AidGenSE
sudo apt install aidgense
sudo aidllm system --sys linux --soc 8550
sudo apt install aid-pkg
```

* Common instructions
```bash
# list available models
sudo aidllm remote-list api
# download model
sudo aidllm pull api aplux/Qwen3-8B-8550-cl2048
# list downloaded models
sudo aidllm list api
# start model api
sudo aidllm start api
# stop model api
sudo aidllm stop api
```

* After "start api", you can use OpenAI HTTP requests to interact with AI model through <device ip>:8888
