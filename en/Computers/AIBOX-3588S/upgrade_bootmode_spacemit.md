# Introduction

## Preface

The AIBOX-3588S comes pre-installed with Linux. If the user wants to run other operating systems, the corresponding firmware needs to be flashed onto the motherboard.

The AIBOX-3588S offers flexible boot options. Generally, unless there is hardware damage, the AIBOX-3588S development board will not become bricked.

If an accident occurs during the upgrade process and the bootloader is corrupted, making a re-upgrade impossible, it is still possible to force-enter the flashing mode to repair it.
