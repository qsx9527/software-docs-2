## Power on

- If it is not the whole machine, install it according to the following steps:
  + Align the gold fingers of the core board (the main chip is facing up) to the card slot on the bottom plate and insert it to the end, and then press the core board to ensure that the buckles on both sides are tightly closed.
  + Connect the power supply of the cooling fan to the FAN interface (near the power interface), place the cooling pad in the center of the heat sink, and then buckle the fan on the main chip to ensure that the cooling pad completely covers the main chip.
- The 12V-5A power adapter is connected to the power cord, the power cord is connected to the 100~220V AC power supply, and the power port on the other end is inserted into the power port of the development board.
- The development board will automatically turn on when it is powered on.

## Network remote login

Ethernet port 0 (near the serial port) is set with a dynamic IP, while Ethernet port 1 (near the HDMI port) is set with a static IP `192.168.150.1`, subnet mask `255.255.255.0`, you can set the PC to `192.168.150.2` /24` for the initial visit.

If the PC can successfully `ping` the IP address of the network port, then you can log in with `ssh`, the port number is `22`, and the username and password are also `linaro`:

```
ssh linaro@192.168.150.1
```

After connecting to the development board, you can modify the network configuration. The method is similar to the Debian/Ubuntu desktop version. You can configure it in the `/etc/network/interfaces.d/` directory.

## Serial terminal access

Please see ["Serial debug"](debug.md).

## Power off

Please try not to directly disconnect the power when shutting down, run `sudo poweroff` first, and then power off to avoid damage to the file system data.

In addition, if you have successfully entered the Linux system, you can also long press the power button, and the system will detect and safely power off the system and development board.
