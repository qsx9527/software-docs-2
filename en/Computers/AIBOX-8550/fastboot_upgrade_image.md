### Check Bootloader 

Open windows terminal (PowerShell), navigate to the location of Android Platform Tools, then run ".\fastboot.exe devices"

If the device is in the bootloader mode, fastboot will show a detected device:

```
PS D:\path\to\platform-tools> .\fastboot.exe devices
xxxxxxxx         fastboot
```

If fastboot shows nothing, please check driver installation and usb cable.

For example:
```
.\fastboot.exe flash boot D:\path\to\boot.img
