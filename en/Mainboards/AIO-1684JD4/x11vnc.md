x11vnc is a tool that allows administrators to connect to the server's real X desktop directly through the VNC Viewer.
## Debian
AIO-1684JD4 has installed the xfce4 desktop and configured the x11vnc related environment by default. The user directly executes the following command to wait for the connection:

```shell
sudo x11vnc -display :0 -auth /var/lib/lightdm/.Xauthority &
```

Then you can use `$bm1684_ip:0` address to VNC remote connection on the PC.

The following is the specific operation process of VNC Viewer:

(1) The user first downloads [VNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/) from the official website, and selects the corresponding installation package according to the PC system to download and install.

(2) After the installation is complete, open VNC Viewer and skip login:

## Ubuntu
To use the X Desktop environment on Ubuntu system, you need to manually install it. Follow these steps, and during the installation process, select `lightdm` as the Display Manager:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y xserver-xorg-video-dummy x11vnc xfce4
sudo vim /etc/X11/xorg.conf
sudo reboot
```
Edit the Xorg configuration file:
```

    Identifier  "Configured Video Device"
    Driver      "dummy"
    VideoRam 256000
EndSection

Section "Monitor"

EndSection
```
