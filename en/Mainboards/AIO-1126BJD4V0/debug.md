If you are doing U-Boot or kernel development, the USB serial adapter (short for USB to serial TTL adapter) is very useful for checking the system startup log, especially when there is no graphical desktop display.

## Buy Adapter

There are many USB adapter to serial port on the shop, divided by chip, there are the following:

* [CP2104](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.5-c.w4002-12605442688.14.aa5e1e8srwECg&id=546045713700)
* PL2303
* CH340

<font color=#ff0000>**Note:** The default baud rate of AIO-1126BJD4V0 is 1500000, some USB to serial chip baud rate can not reach 1500000. The same chip may have different series, so be sure to confirm whether to support before purchasing.</font>

## Hardware Connection

Serial port to USB adapter, there are four pins:

* 3.3V Power, no need to connect.
* GND，Ground, connect to GND pin of the board.
* TXD，Transmit，connect to TX pin of the board.
* RXD，Receive, connect to RX pin of the board.

**Note:** If you encounter the problem that TX and RX cannot input and output when using other serial adapters, you can try to exchange TX and RX connections.

## Parameter Setting

AIO-1126BJD4V0 use the following serial parameters:

* Baud rate: 1500000
* Data bit: 8
* Stop bit: 1
* Parity check: none
* Flow control: none

## Use serial on Windows

### Install Driver

Download driver and install:

* [CH340](https://sparks.gogo.co.nz/ch340.html)
* [PL2303](http://www.prolific.com.tw/US/ShowProduct.aspx?pcid=41)
* [CP210X](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)

If you can’t use PL2303 normally on Win8, use 3.3.5.122 or older version of the old driver, please refer to [This article](https://blog.csdn.net/ropai/article/details/19619951). Please find drivers with version 3.3.5.122 or before.

If you install the CP210X driver from the official website on the Windows system, you can set the serial port baud rate to 1500000 using tools such as PUTTY or SecureCRT. If you cannot set the baud rate or it is invalid, you can download the [old version driver](http://www.t-firefly.com/share/index/index/id/a2e8f25f3d53992bf3e04f45b0e6c8e8.html).

After the adapter is inserted, the system will prompt for the discovery of new hardware and initialization, and then the corresponding COM port can be found in the device manager:

### Install Software

Putty or SecureCRT is generally used on Windows. Among them, we recommend using the free version of MobaXterm. This is a powerful terminal software. Here we will introduce how to use MobaXterm.

[Download MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)：

* Select `session` to `Serial`.
* Modify `Serial port` to the COM port found in the device manager.
* Set `Speed (bsp)` to 1500000.
* Click `OK` button.

## Use serial debug on Ubuntu

There are many options available on Ubuntu:

* minicom
* picocom
* kermit

The following shows how to use minicom.

### Install minicom

```
sudo apt-get install minicom
```

To connect the serial port line, see what the serial port device file is. The following example is `/dev/ttyusb0`:

```
$ ls /dev/ttyUSB*
/dev/ttyUSB0
```

Run:

```
$ sudo minicom
Welcome to minicom 2.7
OPTIONS: I18n
Compiled on Jan  1 2014, 17:13:19.
Port /dev/ttyUSB0, 15:57:00
Press CTRL-A Z for help on special keys
```

Based on the above tips: Press `Ctrl-a` and then press `Z` again to bring up the help menu.
