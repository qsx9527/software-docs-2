- One 12V-5A power adapter.

Optionally purchased accessories include:
- Firefly serial port module.

Additionally, during usage, you might require the following:
- Display device:
    + Monitor or TV with an HDMI interface, along with an HDMI cable.
- Network:
    + 100M/1000M Ethernet cable, wired router.
    + WiFi router.
- Firmware upgrade:
    + TF card, 4GB or larger with a Class 10 rating.
- Debugging:
    + USB to serial adapter.

## Power On

- If not in a cased unit, follow these steps:
  + Align the golden fingers of the Core Board (with the main chip facing upwards) with the slot on the Baseboard, then press down on the Core Board, ensuring the locking clips on both sides securely fasten.
  + Connect the fan power to the FAN interface (near the power interface). Place the cooling pad on the center of the heatsink, then attach the fan to the main chip, ensuring the cooling pad covers the entire chip.
- Connect the 12V-5A power adapter and plug it into a 100~220V AC power source. Insert the other end of the power cable into the power interface of the development board.
- The development board will power on automatically upon being connected to power.

## Remote Network Login

Ethernet port 0 (near the serial port) is configured with DHCP, while Ethernet port 1 (near the HDMI port) is configured with a static IP `192.168.150.1`, subnet mask `255.255.255.0`. You can set your PC's IP to `192.168.150.2/24` for initial access.

If you can successfully `ping` the network interface IP, you can proceed to log in via `ssh`. The port number is `22`, and the username and password are both `linaro`:

```
ssh linaro@192.168.150.1
```

Once connected to the development board, you can modify the network configuration similarly to Debian/Ubuntu desktop versions by configuring files in the `/etc/network/interfaces.d/` directory.

## Serial Terminal Access

Refer to [Serial Debugging](debug.md).

## Power Off

When shutting down, it's recommended to avoid directly disconnecting the power. First, run `sudo poweroff`, then disconnect the power to avoid damaging the file system data.

Additionally, if you've successfully entered the Linux system, you can also press and hold the power button. The system will detect it and safely shut down the system and the development board's power.
